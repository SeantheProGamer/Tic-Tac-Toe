Algorithm:

Game Board:

Create an x and y axis (matrix) representing 3 rows and 3 columns. Create blank tiles initially, and proceed to fill them in with x's or o's as the game progresses. Finally, allow user input on the board with the mouse, to allow the game to be more user friendly.

AI:

For AI to play the game, simply create a series of conditional statements that when met will play a certain move, depending on the position of the x's, o's, and empty spaces.
